# This Application is designed for to tackle in a situations like COVID-19.
# Local E Grocery service is used to order all grocery items by customers from respected local shops.
# Cart Service

1. Customers can add products.
2. Manipulate their own cart.
3. securely access the products and place the all products.

# Address Service

1. Customers can have Multiple addresses.
2. Shop owners also manage their addresses.
3. Manage their own Addresses.

# Identity Service

1. Every customer enjoys the convenience of seamless authentication and authorization.
2. Used JWT token to manage session.
3. Our system employs role-based access control, granting users access based on their designated roles, thus safeguarding sensitive data and operations.
4. users are granted autonomous, non-conflicting access to their individual profiles, allowing them to tailor and oversee their preferences without any concerns of data interference.

  #  1. User Authentication:

Implement user authentication mechanisms like username/password, multi-factor authentication, or OAuth.
Verify user identities securely to prevent unauthorized access.

User Management:

Create, update, and delete user accounts.
Manage user roles and permissions within the system.
User Registration:

Allow users to register for new accounts.
Ensure secure storage of user credentials and personal information.
Token-Based Authentication:

Generate and validate access tokens for authenticated users.
Use tokens for secure communication between microservices.
Authorization:

Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) for authorizing users' access to different microservices.
Define access policies for different resources.
Password Management:

Enforce password policies like complexity and expiration.
Enable users to reset or recover forgotten passwords securely.
Security and Encryption:

Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to protect data in transit.
Encrypt sensitive user data at rest and during transmission.
User Profile Management:

Allow users to manage their profiles, update personal information, and set preferences.
Store user-specific data like user profiles, preferences, and history.
Scalability:

Ensure that the identity service can scale horizontally to handle increasing user loads.
Implement load balancing for improved performance and fault tolerance.
Integration:

Integrate with other microservices for user-related operations, such as billing, notifications, and content management.
Auditing and Logging:

Maintain comprehensive logs and audit trails for security and compliance purposes.
Log authentication and authorization events for monitoring and troubleshooting.
Monitoring and Alerts:

Implement monitoring and alerting systems to detect unusual activities and security breaches.
Set up notifications for suspicious user activities.
User Session Management:

Manage user sessions securely, including session timeout and token refresh.
Implement session persistence if required for a distributed environment.
Compliance and Data Privacy:

Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
Securely handle and store user data in compliance with these regulations.
Testing and Security Audits:

Conduct thorough security testing, including penetration testing and code reviews.
Periodically audit the identity service to identify and rectify vulnerabilities.
API Documentation:

Provide clear and up-to-date documentation for developers and consumers of the identity service API.
Error Handling:

Implement robust error handling and provide informative error messages to users and developers.
Caching:

Use caching mechanisms to improve response times for authentication and authorization checks.
Versioning:

Consider versioning your API to ensure backward compatibility as the service evolves.
Backup and Disaster Recovery:

Implement backup and recovery strategies to safeguard user data in case of data loss or system failures.

# Completely secure Management of Carts,Products,Addresses,Payments,Orders all services.
# fully updated with Exceptions for each API.
